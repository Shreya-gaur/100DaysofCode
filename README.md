# 100DaysofCode

In order to better my coding in python and brush-up on my basic python concepts, I decided to undertake the 100 Day of code challenge.
The main objective of this coding challenge is to learn and stay consistent with your coding practise.

You can find out more about this challenge on the challenge website:

You can even try out Dr. Angela Wu's course on Udemy for a guided approach to 100 Day of Code.
